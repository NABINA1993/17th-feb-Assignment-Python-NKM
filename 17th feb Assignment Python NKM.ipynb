    "Ans:-MongoDB is a popular non-relational database system that uses a document-oriented data model. Unlike traditional relational databases like SQL, non-relational databases like MongoDB do not use tables with fixed schemas to store data. Instead, non-relational databases store data in flexible, semi-structured documents that can be easily nested and hierarchically organized.\n",
    "\n",
    "In scenarios where data is constantly changing or unstructured, non-relational databases like MongoDB can be preferable over SQL databases. This is because non-relational databases are more flexible and can handle unstructured data more easily. Non-relational databases can also be more scalable and performant, particularly when dealing with large volumes of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "MongoDB is often preferred over SQL databases in scenarios such as web applications, real-time analytics, and IoT data management. It is particularly well-suited for applications that require frequent updates and high availability. Additionally, MongoDB is known for its ease of use, flexible data model, and strong community support. However, SQL databases may be preferable in scenarios where data is highly structured, such as financial transactions or accounting data, or where complex queries are needed."

    "Ans:-MongoDB is a popular NoSQL document-oriented database system that offers a number of features that make it a popular choice for modern application development. Some of the key features of MongoDB include:\n",
    "\n",
    "Document-oriented: MongoDB stores data in flexible, semi-structured JSON-like documents, which allows for greater flexibility and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Schema-less: MongoDB does not enforce a predefined schema, which allows for more dynamic and evolving data models.\n",
    "\n",
    "High Availability: MongoDB is designed to ensure high availability, with features such as automatic failover and replica sets to provide fault tolerance.\n",
    "\n",
    "Sharding: MongoDB supports horizontal scaling through sharding, which allows for partitioning of data across multiple machines to improve performance and scalability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Aggregation framework: MongoDB provides a powerful aggregation framework that allows for complex queries and data analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indexing: MongoDB supports indexing, which can improve query performance and allow for fast data retrieval.\n",
    "\n",
    "GridFS: MongoDB includes a built-in file storage system, called GridFS, which allows for efficient storage and retrieval of large files.\n",
    "\n",
    "Geospatial queries: MongoDB supports geospatial queries, allowing for efficient and accurate processing of location-based data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Ad hoc queries: MongoDB allows for ad hoc queries, making it easy to search for and retrieve data as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "ACID Transactions: MongoDB introduced support for multi-document ACID transactions in version 4.0, making it more suitable for transactional use cases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, MongoDB's features make it a versatile and scalable database system that can be used in a wide range of applications, from simple web applications to complex enterprise systems."

For example, you might use delete_one() to remove a single record from a collection, such as when a user deletes a single item from a shopping cart. delete_many() can be used to remove all records matching a specific criteria, such as when removing all items from a shopping cart at once.\n",
